**FloRide** is an end-to-end database application for online cab booking. It is made as a part of course project for the course\
**CSE202: Fundamentals of DataBase Management Systems** that I took in my 4th semester at IIIT Delhi.

It is made using **MySQL/MariaDB** DBMS & **FastAPI** python backend framework. We have also used [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) as our ORM.\
Further detailed documentation as well as instructions to run the application
on your system can be found in the  *UserGuide.pdf*  file inside the *Documentation* directory.

Currently, as our UI, we are using the [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) visual documentation that is provided by the FastAPI framework.

I plan on building its frontend soon, most probably using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) JavaScript Framework. Any suggestions and feedback are welcome.

Fun Fact: The name **FloRide** is based on the character [**Flo**](https://pixarcars.fandom.com/wiki/Flo) in the *cars* series.
